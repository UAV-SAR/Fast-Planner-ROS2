Based on a review of the workspace, here is a breakdown of the packages required for deploying on your own UAV.

fast_planner Directory
Yes, the packages within the fast_planner directory are essential. They constitute the core of the motion planning system.

plan_env: Handles online map creation from sensor data (like your camera).
path_searching: Contains the front-end pathfinding algorithms.
bspline and bspline_opt: Used for trajectory representation and optimization.
traj_utils: Provides utilities for trajectory management.
plan_manage: The high-level manager that integrates all planning components and provides the main interface.
uav_simulator Directory
Most packages in this directory are for simulation and can be excluded. However, some packages, particularly those in Utils, provide essential utilities and message definitions that are also used in a real-world setup.

Necessary Packages from uav_simulator
Message Definitions: You will need the custom ROS message packages that fast_planner depends on.
quadrotor_msgs: Defines core messages like quadrotor_msgs::msg::PositionCommand which the planner outputs.
bspline_msgs: Defines messages for B-spline trajectories.
Utilities:
uav_utils: A header-only library providing crucial geometry and conversion utilities used throughout the planning stack.
pose_utils: Provides utilities for pose manipulation.
Controller:
so3_control: This package provides an SO(3) controller. It takes position commands from the planner and odometry from your state estimation to generate attitude and thrust commands (quadrotor_msgs::msg::SO3Command). You would use this on your companion computer if your flight controller can accept these high-level commands.
Unnecessary Packages from uav_simulator
The following packages are specific to the simulation environment and are not needed for a real flight setup:

so3_quadrotor_simulator: Simulates the quadrotor dynamics. Your real UAV replaces this.
local_sensing: Simulates a depth camera by rendering point clouds. Your physical camera replaces this.
map_generator: Generates random maps for the simulation.
so3_disturbance_generator: Adds noise and disturbances to the simulation.
odom_visualization: A visualization tool for odometry, which is helpful for debugging but not required for operation.
rviz_plugins: Custom plugins for RViz, also not essential for core functionality.
In summary, for a real-world deployment, you need all packages from fast_planner and a selection of utility and message packages from uav_simulator, plus the so3_control package to act as an interface to your drone's flight controller.

Based on the analysis of your workspace, the system appears to be functionally complete and ready for real-hardware usage, provided you correctly integrate your hardware drivers. Supplying the four inputs you listed will result in the generation of SO3Command messages for real-time path planning with collision avoidance.

Here is a breakdown of the data flow that confirms this:

Goal and Perception Input:

Goal: As we've discussed, you can provide a geometry_msgs::msg/PoseStamped to the /goal topic, which the waypoint_generator will convert into a nav_msgs::msg/Path for the planner.
Odometry & Point Cloud/Depth Image: The plan_env package, specifically the SDFMap class, is designed to handle this. It has subscribers for odometry (odomCallback) and sensor data like point clouds (cloudCallback) or depth images (depthOdomCallback). It uses this information to build the environment representation (ESDF map) required for collision avoidance.
Planning and Trajectory Generation:

The plan_manage package uses the map from plan_env and the goal path to compute a safe and dynamically feasible trajectory.
It then publishes this trajectory as a bspline_msgs::msg::Bspline message on the /planning/bspline topic.
Trajectory Execution to PositionCommand:

The node in your active file, traj_server.cpp, subscribes to /planning/bspline.
Its cmdCallback function acts as a trajectory follower. It evaluates the B-spline at the current time to get the desired state (position, velocity, acceleration, yaw).
It then publishes this state as a quadrotor_msgs::msg::PositionCommand message to the /position_cmd topic.
PositionCommand to SO3Command:

The so3_control package subscribes to both the /position_cmd topic (position_cmd_callback) and your odometry topic (odom_callback).
It uses these inputs in its internal controller (SO3Control::calculateControl) to compute the necessary forces and orientation.
Finally, it publishes the result as a quadrotor_msgs::msg::SO3Command on the /so3_cmd topic (publishSO3Command).
In conclusion, the entire pipeline from your specified inputs to the final SO3Command output is present and correctly connected within the workspace. The system is designed for this exact purpose.
